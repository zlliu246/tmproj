In fall of 1990, Beyoncé enrolled in Parker Elementary School, a music magnet school in Houston, where she would perform with the school's choir. She also attended the High School for the Performing and Visual Arts and later Alief Elsik High School. Beyoncé was also a member of the choir at St. John's United Methodist Church as a soloist for two years.

They were placed into a group with three other girls as Girl's Tyme, and rapped and danced on the talent show circuit in Houston. After seeing the group, R&amp;B producer Arne Frager brought them to his Northern California studio and placed them in Star Search, the largest talent show on national TV at the time. Girl's Tyme failed to win, and Beyoncé later said the song they performed was not good. In 1995 Beyoncé's father resigned from his job to manage the group. The move reduced Beyoncé's family's income by half, and her parents were forced to move into separated apartments. Mathew cut the original line-up to four and the group continued performing as an opening act for other established R&amp;B girl groups. The girls auditioned before record labels and were finally signed to Elektra Records, moving to Atlanta Records briefly to work on their first recording, only to be cut by the company. This put further strain on the family, and Beyoncé's parents separated. On October 5, 1995, Dwayne Wiggins's Grass Roots Entertainment signed the group. In 1996, the girls began recording their debut album under an agreement with Sony Music, the Knowles family reunited, and shortly after, the group got a contract with Columbia Records.</td>\n",

       "0    Beyoncé Giselle Knowles-Carter (/biːˈjɒnseɪ/ bee-YON-say) (born September 4, 1981) is an American singer, songwriter, record producer and actress. Born and raised in Houston, Texas, she performed in various singing and dancing competitions as a child, and rose to fame in the late 1990s as lead singer of R&B girl-group Destiny's Child. Managed by her father, Mathew Knowles, the group became one of the world's best-selling girl groups of all time. Their hiatus saw the release of Beyoncé's debut album, Dangerously in Love (2003), which established her as a solo artist worldwide, earned five Grammy Awards and featured the Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles \"Crazy in Love\" and \"Baby Boy\".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ...  beyonce giselle knowles-carter september 4 1981 american houston texas the late 1990s r&b destiny mathew knowles beyonce 2003 five 100 one crazy in love baby boy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

Beyoncé also ventured into acting, with a Golden Globe-nominated performance in Dreamgirls (2006), and starring roles in The Pink Panther (2006) and Obsessed (2009). Her marriage to rapper Jay Z and portrayal of Etta James in Cadillac Records (2008) influenced her third album, I Am... Sasha Fierce (2008), which saw the birth of her alter-ego Sasha Fierce and earned a record-setting six Grammy Awards in 2010, including Song of the Year for \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\". Beyoncé took a hiatus from music in 2010 and took over management of her career; her fourth album 4 (2011) was subsequently mellower in tone, exploring 1970s funk, 1980s pop, and 1990s soul. Her critically acclaimed fifth studio album, Beyoncé (2013), was distinguished from previous releases by its experimental production and exploration of darker themes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ...  june 2005 second b'day 2006 \"deja vu\" irreplaceable beautiful liar beyonce golden globe dreamgirls 2006 the pink panther obsessed 2009 jay z etta james cadillac records 2008 third sasha fierce 2008 sasha fierce six grammy awards 2010 song the year single ladies beyonce 2010 fourth 2011 1970s 1980s 1990s fifth beyonce 2013                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

       "52   Beyoncé attended St. Mary's Elementary School in Fredericksburg, Texas, where she enrolled in dance classes. Her singing talent was discovered when dance instructor Darlette Johnson began humming a song and she finished it, able to hit the high-pitched notes. Beyoncé's interest in music and performing continued after winning a school talent show at age seven, singing John Lennon's \"Imagine\" to beat 15/16-year-olds. In fall of 1990, Beyoncé enrolled in Parker Elementary School, a music magnet school in Houston, where she would perform with the school's choir. She also attended the High School for the Performing and Visual Arts and later Alief Elsik High School.

       "63   At age eight, Beyoncé and childhood friend Kelly Rowland met LaTavia Roberson while in an audition for an all-girl entertainment group. They were placed into a group with three other girls as Girl's Tyme, and rapped and danced on the talent show circuit in Houston. After seeing the group, R&B producer Arne Frager brought them to his Northern California studio and placed them in Star Search, the largest talent show on national TV at the time. Girl's Tyme failed to win, and Beyoncé later said the song they performed was not good. In 1995 Beyoncé's father resigned from his job to manage the group. The move reduced Beyoncé's family's income by half, and her parents were forced to move into separated apartments. Mathew cut the original line-up to four and the group continued performing as an opening act for other established R&B girl groups. The girls auditioned before record labels and were finally signed to Elektra Records, moving to Atlanta Records briefly to work on their first recording, only to be cut by the company. This put further strain on the family, and Beyoncé's parents separated. On October 5, 1995, Dwayne Wiggins's Grass Roots Entertainment signed the group. In 1996, the girls began recording their debut album under an agreement with Sony Music, the Knowles family reunited, and shortly after, the group got a contract with Columbia Records.  ...  age eight beyonce kelly rowland latavia roberson three girl's tyme houston r&b arne frager northern california star search tyme beyonce 1995 beyonce beyonce half mathew up to four r&b elektra records atlanta records first beyonce october 5 1995 dwayne wiggins's grass roots entertainment 1996 sony music knowles columbia records                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

In 1997, Destiny's Child released their major label debut song \"Killing Time\" on the soundtrack to the 1997 film, Men in Black. The following year, the group released their self-titled debut album, scoring their first major hit \"No, No, No\". The album established the group as a viable act in the music industry, with moderate sales and winning the group three Soul Train Lady of Soul Awards for Best R&B/Soul Album of the Year, Best R&B/Soul or Rap New Artist, and Best R&B/Soul Single for \"No, No, No\". The group released their multi-platinum second album The Writing's on the Wall in 1999. The record features some of the group's most widely known songs such as \"Bills, Bills, Bills\", the group's first number-one single, \"Jumpin' Jumpin'\" and \"Say My Name\", which became their most successful song at the time, and would remain one of their signature songs. \"Say My Name\" won the Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals and the Best R&B Song at the 43rd Annual Grammy Awards. The Writing's on the Wall sold more than eight million copies worldwide. During this time, Beyoncé recorded a duet with Marc Nelson, an original member of Boyz II Men, on the song \"After All Is Said and Done\" for the soundtrack to the 1999 film, The Best Man.                      ...  destiny 1996 the book of isaiah 1997 destiny child killing time 1997 men in black the following year first three soul train lady of soul awards for best r&b/soul album of the year rap new artist soul single second the writing's on the wall in 1999 bills bills bills first one jumpin' jumpin' say my name say my name the best r&b performance by a duo or group with vocals 43rd annual grammy awards the writing's wall more than eight million beyonce marc nelson boyz ii men after all is said and done 1999 the best man\n",
       "89   LeToya Luckett and Roberson became unhappy with Mathew's managing of the band and eventually were replaced by Farrah Franklin and Michelle Williams. Beyoncé experienced depression following the split with Luckett and Roberson after being publicly blamed by the media, critics, and blogs for its cause. Her long-standing boyfriend left her at this time. The depression was so severe it lasted for a couple of years, during which she occasionally kept herself in her bedroom for days and refused to eat anything. Beyoncé stated that she struggled to speak about her depression because Destiny's Child had just won their first Grammy Award and she feared no one would take her seriously. Beyoncé would later speak of her mother as the person who helped her fight it. Franklin was dismissed, leaving just Beyoncé, Rowland, and Williams.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ...  letoya luckett roberson mathew farrah franklin michelle williams beyonce luckett roberson a couple of years days beyonce destiny child first grammy award beyonce franklin beyonce rowland williams                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

In early 2001, while Destiny's Child was completing their third album, Beyoncé landed a major role in the MTV made-for-television film, Carmen: A Hip Hopera, starring alongside American actor Mekhi Phifer. Set in Philadelphia, the film is a modern interpretation of the 19th century opera Carmen by French composer Georges Bizet. When the third album Survivor was released in May 2001, Luckett and Roberson filed a lawsuit claiming that the songs were aimed at them. The album debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200, with first-week sales of 663,000 copies sold.

      "34740    palmerston died in 1865, and after a brief ministry led by russell, derby returned to power. in 1866, victoria attended the state opening of parliament for the first time since albert's death. the following year she supported the passing of the reform act 1867 which doubled the electorate by extending the franchise to many urban working men, though she was not in favour of votes for women. derby resigned in 1868, to be replaced by benjamin disraeli, who charmed victoria. \"everyone likes flattery,\" he said, \"and when you come to royalty you should lay it on with a trowel.\" with the phrase \"we authors, ma'am\", he complimented her. disraeli's ministry only lasted a matter of months, and at the end of the year his liberal rival, william ewart gladstone, was appointed prime minister. victoria found gladstone's demeanour far less appealing; he spoke to her, she is thought to have complained, as though she were \"a public meeting rather than a woman\".                                                                                                         \n",
      "35135    in the 1874 general election, disraeli was returned to power. he passed the public worship regulation act 1874, which removed catholic rituals from the anglican liturgy and which victoria strongly supported. she preferred short, simple services, and personally considered herself more aligned with the presbyterian church of scotland than the episcopal church of england. he also pushed the royal titles act 1876 through parliament, so that victoria took the title \"empress of india\" from 1 may 1876. the new title was proclaimed at the delhi durbar of 1 january 1877.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

[...] because she made not one but two of the decade's greatest singles, with crazy in love and single ladies (put a ring on it), not to mention her hits with destiny's child; and this was the decade when singles – particularly r&b singles – regained their status as pop's favourite medium. [...] [she] and not any superannuated rock star was arguably the greatest live performer of the past 10 years.\" in 2013, beyoncé made the time 100 list, baz luhrmann writing \"no one has that voice, no one moves the way she moves, no one can hold an audience the way she does... when beyoncé does an album, when beyoncé sings a song, when beyoncé does anything, it's an event, and it's broadly influential. right now, she is the heir-apparent diva of the usa — the reigning national voice.\" in 2014, beyoncé was listed again on the time 100 and also featured on the cover of the issue.\n",
